%% This is a template for the Bard Presentation Style, which is used in
%% conjunction with the Seminar document class.
%%
%% Copy it to a new file with a new name and use it as the basis
%% for a presentation.
%%
%% Replace everything inside <   > with the appropriate text,
%% and remove the <   >.
%%
%% Put a comment symbol (%) before anything in the template you 
%% do not need.
%%
%% Add as many slides as you need.
%%
%% Read the manual bardpresentation_man.tex or bardpresentation_man.pdf 
%% for more details regarding the Bard Presentation Style.
%%
%% The Bard Presentation Style file and the manual for this style file
%% can be found at http://math.bard.edu/bloch/bardtex.htm
%%
%% For additional help, or for suggestions or corrections
%% contact Ethan Bloch at bloch@bard.edu
%%
%% This style file requires some LaTeX packages, which might already 
%% be available in your implementation of TeX, and if needed can be downloaded
%% from http://math.bard.edu/bloch/bardtex.htm
