# Generating anamorphic projections for a single and two view model.
_Undergraduate Senior Thesis_ by _Van Mai Nguyen Thi_

## Abstract

An anamorphic projection is an image that is intentionally distorted so that the original
image can be seen only when looked at from a certain perspective, or using a special device,
for example a mirror. Origins of anamorphosis can be traced back to the 16th century art,
but beyond the aesthetic values, anamorphosis has found its uses in many practical settings,
such as road signs, and keystone correction. Despite the widespread uses, there is a scarcity
of detailed explanation of the mathematical principles behind anamorphosis, and there is
hardly any computer software generating the anamorphic projections. The goal of this project
is to apply computer vision techniques to create a program that automates the process of
generating anamorphic projections. We use a projector-camera system to derive homography
mappings between the projector and camera image, and propose a method for generating an
optimal anamorphic image for multiple viewers using least squares.
